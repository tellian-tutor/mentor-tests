  "text": "Go / No-Go decision with risk controls (the AI will ask follow-ups).\n\nContext:\nYou planned a 20–25 NM coastal trip with an inexperienced crew. Forecast: wind increases from 6 m/s to 12–14 m/s by evening, possible gusts. There are several potential shelters along the route. Your vessel is in good condition, but you want to minimize risk.\n\nTask:\nMake a decision (go / go with changes / no-go). Explain using a structured risk model:\n- Risks\n- Controls (preventive measures)\n- Triggers (clear criteria to turn back / seek shelter)\n- Plan B\n\nThen answer 2–3 follow-up questions from the AI.",
  "difficulty": 5,
  "correct_answer": "A strong answer chooses a conservative decision aligned with crew skill and forecast trend (often 'go with changes' or 'no-go' depending on vessel/area). It explicitly lists key risks (wind increase, gusts, fatigue, seasickness, navigation workload, reduced safety margins), preventive controls (shorten route, earlier departure, reefing plan if relevant, safe speed policy, mandatory lifejackets, role assignment, comms checks, shelter waypoints, daylight constraints), triggers (wind/sea state thresholds, visibility, crew condition, time limits, equipment issues), and Plan B (nearest shelters, abort points, communication plan, return route).\n\nThe best responses are measurable: they define thresholds and decision points, not vague statements. They also show humility: re-check forecast, local effects, and continuously reassess.",
  "explanation": "This is a high-signal question: it reveals judgment, risk literacy, and operational discipline.",
  "ai_context": "Use 2–3 Socratic follow-ups to force specificity. Focus on: (1) thresholds (wind/sea/visibility/time), (2) crew risk controls (roles, fatigue, lifejackets), (3) shelter/abort points and communication plan. Score practical decision-making and measurable triggers; penalize vague 'we'll be careful' answers.",
