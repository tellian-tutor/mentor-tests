I won\u2019t be home.\u201d\n\nWrite your reply. Keep it short (2\u20134 sentences). Offer clear options and next steps.\n\nAgent capabilities (assume you CAN do these):\n- Contact dispatch/courier to confirm a realistic ETA window.\n- Offer rescheduling to a specific time window (today or next available day).\n- Change delivery address BEFORE the courier arrives (policy permitting).\n- Redirect to a pickup point / parcel locker (if available).\n- Cancel the order and initiate refund according to policy.\n- Offer a standard compensation option only if policy allows (no ad\u2011hoc promises).",

  "correct_answer": "A strong reply: acknowledges frustration, gives verified ETA with uncertainty language, offers 2\u20133 realistic options (reschedule window, change address/pickup point, cancel/refund where policy allows), confirms the chosen option, and aligns with what the agent promised earlier.",
  "explanation": "Resolution messages are judged by options quality and operational clarity (who does what next).",
  "ai_context": "Must reference previous answers: if the agent promised to 'call back in 5 minutes' or used a specific tone, check consistency. Look for: (1) options, (2) policy-safe wording (no unapproved refunds/discounts), (3) no overpromising, (4) clear next step + confirmation question, (5) concise chat style. Also check whether the student's options align with the listed agent capabilities. Refer to ISO/SOP references from the test description when providing feedback.",
