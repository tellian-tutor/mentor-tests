  "correct_answer": "Verify the order in the system (tracking/dispatch) using the provided identifiers, and clarify the minimum missing detail if needed before promising a solution.",
  "explanation": "Verification before action is the core support principle. Option A (explain delays) shifts the burden to the customer and sounds dismissive. Option B (repeat the complaint) wastes time and frustrates an already upset customer. Option D (immediate compensation) violates policy \u2014 you cannot promise refunds or compensation before confirming the facts. Option C is correct: check the system first with the identifiers you have, ask only for what's missing, then propose solutions based on verified facts.",
  "ai_context": "Evaluate the student's choice. Option 0 (explain delays) is passive and dismissive \u2014 it shifts responsibility to the customer. Option 1 (repeat complaint) wastes the customer's time and signals the agent wasn't listening. Option 2 (check system + ask only missing detail) is correct: it's efficient, fact-based, and respects the customer's time. Option 3 (immediate compensation + unrealistic promise) violates policy and sets false expectations. Refer to ISO/SOP references from the test description when providing feedback."
