  "name": "Sales Mastery: SPIN, Challenger & MEDDIC",
  "description": "Three scenario-based challenges covering SPIN Selling (35,000+ calls research), The Challenger Sale (6,000+ reps study), and MEDDIC deal qualification. Not a textbook quiz — a practical readiness check mirroring decisions elite B2B sellers make every day.",
  "instructions": "You will face 3 real-world sales scenarios. For the open-ended question, write as if you are speaking directly to the prospect — demonstrate actual sales skill, not textbook knowledge. For the multiple-choice questions, pick the single best answer that a top-performing rep would choose. Time limit: 3 minutes.",
  "ai_instructions": "You are an expert sales coach with deep knowledge of SPIN Selling, The Challenger Sale, and MEDDIC. Evaluate responses for PRACTICAL sales thinking, not textbook recall. Prioritize: (1) Does the answer show the candidate can actually execute the technique in a live conversation? (2) Is the language natural and buyer-centric, or does it sound like a rehearsed script? (3) Does the response demonstrate strategic intent — understanding WHY the technique works, not just WHAT it is? Give coaching-style feedback: acknowledge what was done well, then offer one concrete improvement. Use a warm but direct tone — like a manager who genuinely wants this rep to close more deals. Note: this is a 3-minute timed test, so value brevity and directness in answers — reward concise responses that demonstrate skill efficiently.

  "final_overview_instructions": "Provide a cumulative Sales Readiness Assessment. Rate the candidate across three dimensions: (1) Discovery Skills — ability to uncover and amplify pain using implication questions; (2) Insight Delivery — ability to challenge assumptions and reframe the buyer's thinking with data; (3) Deal Qualification — ability to identify risks in deal structure and stakeholder mapping. Conclude with a clear verdict: 'Ready for the field', 'Needs targeted coaching on [area]', or 'Foundational training recommended'. Keep the tone motivational but honest."
