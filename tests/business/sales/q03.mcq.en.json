  "text": "You're working a deal that looks promising. The VP of Operations at a manufacturing company loves your supply-chain optimization platform. After an enthusiastic demo, he tells you: \"This is exactly what we need. I'll push this through internally — you'll have a PO by end of month.\"\n\nHere's what you know:\n- Budget has been verbally confirmed for Q2\n- Timeline aligns with their fiscal planning cycle\n- The operations team has seen a full demo and is excited\n- You have NOT met anyone from procurement, legal, or finance\n- The VP appears to be the only person driving this deal internally\n\nUsing MEDDIC qualification, what is the BIGGEST risk in this deal?",
  "difficulty": 3,
  "options": [
    "Budget might get reallocated to other priorities before the PO is issued",
    "The VP is likely not the Economic Buyer and there is no identified Champion beyond him — if he hits internal resistance, the deal has no second path to power",
    "The timeline is too aggressive for a deal that hasn't gone through procurement",
    "The operations team hasn't completed a formal technical evaluation with documented requirements"
  ],
  "correct_index": 1,
  "allow_multiple": false,
  "correct_answer": "The biggest risk is a MEDDIC gap in Economic Buyer and Champion identification. The VP loves the solution but is likely not the person who can sign off on budget — that typically sits with finance, procurement, or C-suite. Worse, he appears to be the sole internal advocate: if he hits resistance from procurement, legal, or a competing priority, the deal has no alternative path to power. In MEDDIC terms, you have an Enthusiastic User, but potentially no true Economic Buyer access and no validated Champion who has political capital to navigate internal objections.",
  "explanation": "MEDDIC (Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Identify Pain, Champion) is the gold standard for enterprise deal qualification. In this scenario, the most dangerous gap is the intersection of Economic Buyer and Champion. The VP's enthusiasm is encouraging, but enthusiasm is not the same as organizational power. A true Economic Buyer can unilaterally approve budget; a true Champion has the political capital and motivation to sell internally on your behalf — even when you're not in the room. When one person is both your only access point and your only advocate, you're one org-chart surprise away from a dead deal. Budget reallocation (A) is a real but secondary risk. Timeline (C) and technical evaluation (D) are tactical issues, not structural ones. The structural risk — single-threaded access to power — is what kills enterprise deals most often. Top MEDDIC practitioners would immediately ask: 'Who else needs to sign off? Can I meet your procurement team? What has the approval process looked like for purchases of this size in the past?'",
  "ai_context": "This tests MEDDIC deal qualification, specifically the ability to identify structural deal risk. The correct answer (B, index 1) identifies the most critical gap: the deal is single-threaded through one stakeholder who may not be the Economic Buyer, and there is no validated Champion with organizational power to navigate internal obstacles. Option A (budget reallocation) is a valid risk but not the biggest structural issue. Option C (timeline) is a tactical concern. Option D (technical evaluation) is important but secondary to the power structure question. The key insight is that a single enthusiastic VP does not equal a qualified deal — MEDDIC requires validated access to the Economic Buyer and an identified Champion with political capital. Students who choose B demonstrate they understand that deal structure matters more than deal enthusiasm.
