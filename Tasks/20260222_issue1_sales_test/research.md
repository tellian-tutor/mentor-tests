# Research: Sales Training Methodologies

## Methodologies Analyzed

### 1. SPIN Selling (Neil Rackham, 1988)
- Based on 35,000+ sales call analysis by Huthwaite Inc
- Framework: Situation → Problem → Implication → Need-Payoff
- Key insight: Top performers ask 4x more Implication questions
- Implication questions make buyers feel the weight of unresolved problems

### 2. The Challenger Sale (Dixon & Adamson, 2011)
- Based on CEB/Gartner research of 6,000 reps across 90 companies
- 40% of top performers are "Challengers"
- Three abilities: Teach, Tailor, Take Control
- Five archetypes: Hard Worker, Challenger, Relationship Builder, Lone Wolf, Reactive Problem Solver
- Key insight: Relationship-building alone is a losing strategy in complex B2B

### 4. Others Reviewed (not selected for demo)
- Sandler Selling System — 7-step submarine, up-front contracts
- Solution Selling — problem-led, pain sheets, value justification
- BANT — Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline (simple qualification)
- Gap Selling — current state vs future state gap analysis
- Miller Heiman Strategic Selling — four buying influences, Blue Sheet

## Selection Rationale

**SPIN + Challenger + MEDDIC chosen because:**
1. Span the full sales cycle: discovery → insight delivery → deal qualification
2. Most frequently cited in industry "top methodologies" rankings
3. Strong research backing creates credibility for demo
4. A prospect seeing these thinks "this platform knows real sales training"
5. Creates FOMO: "If I don't know these, I'm behind my peers"
