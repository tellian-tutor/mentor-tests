# Test-Pass Results: Sales Demo Test

A subagent took the test as a B2B SaaS rep with 3 years experience.

## Scores

| Q# | Topic | Type | Score | Notes |
|----|-------|------|-------|-------|
| Q1 | SPIN Discovery | open_text | 0.7-0.8 | Good implication questions, missed board credibility angle |
| Q2 | Challenger Reframe | MCQ | 1.0 | Correct, with reasoning matching model answer |
| Q3 | MEDDIC Qualification | MCQ | 1.0 | Correct, identified single-threaded deal risk |

## Demo Experience Assessment

### Timing: ~3 minutes (confirmed)
- Q1: ~90 seconds (write implication questions)
- Q2: ~30-45 seconds (read scenario + choose)
- Q3: ~45-60 seconds (longer scenario)

### Wow Factor: Strong
- Q1 is the star — AI evaluating free-text sales questions is the differentiator
- "That's what I pay our sales managers to do, and half don't do it this well"

### FOMO Triggers
- Gap between "knowing theory" and "executing under pressure"
- Wanting deeper practice on missed angles
- Desire for progressive difficulty and peer comparison

### MCQ Distractor Quality
- Q2 Option A (Relationship Builder) — strong distractor, feels consultative
- Q2 Option D (discount) — too obviously wrong, could be stronger
- Q3 Option A (budget risk) — solid distractor
- Q3 Option D (tech eval) — weakest

### Improvement Suggestions from Test-Pass
1. Q2 Option D could be a more tempting distractor (replace discount with discovery-style option)
2. Q1 min_words=30 might be too low for 2-3 questions (consider 50)
3. Test name "Sales Mastery" sets high bar — but works for FOMO
4. Meta description positioning is excellent
